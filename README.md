# uog-gpa-calc

GPA Calculator specifically for University of Guelph students. 

Using UoG's Grade Point Equivalency table, and information directly from the user about credit weight, lecture hours, lab hours and percentage received in each course, you can calculate your semesterly GPA, or cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale.

Required Knowledge:

- Credit Weight (weight of course; usually 0.5, 0.75 or 1.00)
- Lecture Hours (how many lecture hours per week. For DE courses it is usually 3 hours)
- Lab Hours (how many hours in lab/seminar per week)
- Percentage Grade Received in Course (out of 100)

As it stands, user interface is through command line. You can run this application on a an emulator by compiling and running the Main class. You can also run the program on a Java IDE such as IntelliJ (on which this was developed) or Eclipse.
